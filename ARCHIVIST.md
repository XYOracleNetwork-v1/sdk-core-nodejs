# Getting started with an XYO Archivist

An archivist in the XYO network serves as the data-layer component between the bridge and the diviner.
It accepts and aggregates data from bridges and makes that data available to Diviners via a GraphQL API.

As long as an archivist follows the protocols of the XYO network specified in the [yellow paper](https://docs.xyo.network/XYO-Yellow-Paper.pdf)
they may implement the component however they wish. This application supports using MySQL as the persistence engine that
backs the archivist repository, LevelDb to persist origin-chain data specific to this node, and TCP as the transport
layer for doing bound-witness interactions between the Archivist and other Bridges.

# Getting Started

##### Clone the repository 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XYOracleNetwork/sdk-core-nodejs.git -b develop
```

##### Go into the directory

```bash
cd sdk-core-nodejs
```

##### Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

##### Build the SDK

```bash
yarn build
```

##### Bootstrap or manage your MySQL service

```sh
  yarn manage:db
```

##### Start the Archivist

```bash
yarn start:archivist
```

##### Pull in some mock data
**You'll have to do this in another terminal window or tab**

```bash
yarn mock-data
```

##### Run your package

```bash
node package/app
```

You will now be directed to configure your archivist, please follow these steps **exactly** as written (if for some reason you are running any instances on ports (except the database port 3306) you can change the last digit by one):

`No config found, would you like to create one now? (Y/n) · true`

`What would you like to name your XYO Node? · <your name>`

`Where would you like to store your data? · /Users/<yourUserDirectory>/<yourProjectDirectory>/sdk-core-nodejs/packages/app/node-data`

`What is your public ip address? · 0.0.0.0`

`What port would you like to use for your peer to peer protocol? · 11500`

`Do you want to add bootstrap nodes? (Y/n) · true`

`These addresses were found on the `peers.xyo.network` DNS record.You can select and deselect each address by pressing spacebar · Hit enter and do not select items`

This will default to false, press `y` or `t`
`Do you want to add any more individual bootstrap nodes? (y/N) · true`

Go ahead and enter the example address provided
`What is the address value of the bootstrap node? Should look something like /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/11500 · /127.0.0.1/tcp/11500`

This will default to false, now we hit enter
`Do you want to add any more individual bootstrap nodes? (y/N) · false`

Ensure that your archivist can do bound witness
`Do you want your node to act as a server for doing bound-witnesses? (Y/n) · true`

Select your port for peer to peer protocol 
`What port would you like to use for your peer to peer protocol? · 11000`

Ensure that the component features for support are Archivist
`Which component features do you want your Xyo Node to support? · archivist`

Set up the database with the values from your bootstrapping earlier
`Enter the `host` value for your MySQL database · 127.0.0.1`
`Enter the `user` value for your MySQL database · admin`
`Enter the `password` value for your MySQL database · password`
`Enter the `database` value for your MySQL database · Xyo`
**This is the one port value that you should not have to change!**
`Enter the `port` value for your MySQL database · 3306`

Set up your archivist with a GraphQL Server
`Do you want your node to have a GraphQL server (Y/n) · true`
`What port should your GraphQL server run on? · 11001`

`Which GraphQL api endpoints would you like to support? (use space-bar to toggle selection. Press enter once finished) · about, blockByHash, blockList, intersections, blocksByPublicKey, entities`

Start the node
`Do you want to start the node after configuration is complete? (Y/n) · true`

You will see some GraphQL data and dialing nodes, notice the Xyo objects and nodes at work! 

You should then see that you have discovered a peer, which will feed your archivist heuristics! Exciting stuff! 

## Congratulations! You have now started an XYO Archivist!
